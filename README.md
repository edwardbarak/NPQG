# NEOCLASSICAL PHYSICS AND QUANTUM GRAVITY

Imagine that nature emerges from ample pairs of immutable Planck radius spherical particles, the electrino and the positrino, which are equal yet oppositely charged. These are the only carriers of energy, in electromagnetic and kinetic form. The are located in an infinite 3D Euclidean space (non curvy) and observe classical mechanics and Maxwell’s equations. **NPQG** explores this recipe for nature and how it emerges as a narrative and theory that is compatible with GR, QM, modified ΛCDM, yet superior in ability to explain the universe and resolve open problems.

For **NPQG** basics see: *[Idealized Neoclassical Model](https://johnmarkmorris.com/2019/06/24/idealized-neoclassical-model/)* and the *[NPQG Glosssary](https://johnmarkmorris.com/2019/06/12/glossary-of-neoclassical-physics-and-quantum-gravity/)*.
